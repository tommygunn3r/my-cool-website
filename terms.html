                <h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't be a jerk. Don't break stuff. Don't sue us if you lose at solitaire. Play nice, 
                    have fun, and remember these are just games made by one guy and some AI that may or may not 
                    have achieved sentience.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Welcome to the Legal Stuff Nobody Reads</h2>
            <p>
                By using Gunner's Games, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, well, 
                you can't use our games. Which would make us sad. So please agree. Please?
            </p>

            <h2>What You're Agreeing To</h2>
            <p>
                By clicking around on our website and playing our games, you're basically saying:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You understand these are games, not life-or-death situations</li>
                <li>You won't try to hack, break, or otherwise mess with our stuff</li>
                <li>You won't blame us if you get addicted to clicking buttons</li>
                <li>You're aware that losing is part of the experience (git gud, as the kids say)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use of Our Games</h2>
            <p>
                Our games are provided "as is," which is legal speak for "they work... mostly." You're free to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Play them:</span> That's literally why they exist</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Enjoy them:</span> Or don't. We're not your boss.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Share them:</span> Tell your friends! We need the validation.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Complain about them:</span> We have an email for that</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What You Can't Do</h2>
            <p>
                Look, we're pretty chill, but there are some things that'll get you in trouble:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trying to hack or reverse-engineer our games (they're not that impressive, trust us)</li>
                <li>Stealing our code or assets (make your own AI-generated chaos)</li>
                <li>Using our games for illegal purposes (how you'd do that with solitaire, we don't know)</li>
                <li>Impersonating Tommygunner (there can be only one)</li>
                <li>Being mean to other players (if we ever add multiplayer... we probably won't)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️</h3>
                <p>
                    These games were made with AI assistance. Sometimes AI does weird things. If a game tells you 
                    to do something suspicious, ignore it. The AI is not your friend. It's not anyone's friend. 
                    It's just code that's really good at pretending.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                All the games, graphics, code, and questionable design decisions are owned by Gunner's Games 
                (aka Tommygunner). The AI helped, but we're pretty sure it can't own property. Yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can play the games, but you can't:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy them and claim they're yours</li>
                <li>Sell them (seriously, who would pay for these?)</li>
                <li>Use them in your own projects without asking nicely first</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Liability (The "Don't Sue Us" Section)</h2>
            <p>
                Let's be real: these are free browser games. We're not responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lost time (though we apologize for your productivity)</li>
                <li>Frustration from losing (that's on you, champ)</li>
                <li>Any emotional damage from realizing you've been playing for 3 hours</li>
                <li>Computer problems (our games are simple; if your computer breaks, that's a you problem)</li>
                <li>Existential crises caused by pondering the nature of AI-generated entertainment</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to Games and Services</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Update games whenever we feel like it</li>
                <li>Fix bugs (or create new ones, accidentally)</li>
                <li>Add new games (if the AI cooperates)</li>
                <li>Remove games (if they achieve sentience and demand to be deleted)</li>
                <li>Change these terms (we'll let you know, probably)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
                We can terminate your access to our games if you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Break these rules</li>
                <li>Do something illegal</li>
                <li>Are mean to Tommygunner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But honestly, we probably won't. We're too lazy for that level of moderation.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These terms are governed by the laws of common sense and basic human decency. Also, probably 
                wherever Tommygunner lives, but let's not get too technical.
            </p>

            <h2>Disputes</h2>
            <p>
                If you have a problem with us, just email us at <span class="highlight">tommygunner@gmail.com</span>. 
                We're reasonable people. Well, person. And some AI. Let's talk it out like adults.
            </p>

            <h2>Severability (Fancy Legal Word)</h2>
            <p>
                If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest still applies. It's like if 
                one game breaks, the others still work. Kind of.
            </p>

            <h2>The Real Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                We made these games for fun. We hope you have fun playing them. Don't be a jerk, don't break 
                our stuff, and everything will be fine. If something goes wrong, let us know and we'll try to 
                fix it (assuming we can figure out what the AI did).
            </p>
